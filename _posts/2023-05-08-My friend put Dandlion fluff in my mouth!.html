    <p>Long time to no see, I'm komugikotan, Hi.</p>
    <h3 id="UPDATE Blog!!!!!"> UPDATE Blog!!!!!</h3>
    <p>I wasn't updating blog for a long time, But I was not dead. I was simply busy with school, programming and studying.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Oh, I'm active on Github, so if <strong>you're interested in programming</strong>, take a look! (Just advertising) ⇓</p>

    <p>So I'm going to tell you about a strange event that happened at school for the first time in a while.  </p>
    <h3 id="Things happened in School">Things happened in School</h3>
    <p>Today, I went to school as usual. We had a haiku class today, and we were supposed to write haiku while looking at the scenery outside. So we went outside for write haiku.</p>
    <p>There were lots of dandelions blooming, so I thought I would write a haiku about dandelions. But it was very difficult to write haiku in English, so I wrote them in Japanese anyway.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Then girls from my class came over and said, "Can't you think of anything?" And they started talking to me like, "You can't think of any?"  I responded with something like, "Oh, I can't think of any," but then these girls asked me, "Do you think dandelions would taste good if you ate them?" (Why would they ask me such a question?) I was answering appropriately when L-chan, who calls herself "L", suddenly</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong><span style="font-size: 200%;">Putted dandelions (cotton wool) in my mouth. To make it eat.</span></strong></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Of course, I thought I wouldn't eat it. But,</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong><span style="font-size: 200%;">I accidenly swallowed a third of it.</span></strong></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>I instantly spat out about two-thirds of it, but I swallowed a third of it.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The girl L says, "I thought your mouth would close when I offered it to you,"</p>
    <p>There was no way I would close my mouth in time that suddenly.</p>
    <p>So I accidently swallowed it.</p>
    <h3>Bye, See you long time after this post</h3>
    <p>Well, it was such a shocking event that I blogged about it. I didn't expect her to make me eat dandelion and I didn't expect me to swallow it. Well, I'm sure it's ok because it probably won't cause any health damage to me, but... sweat.</p>
    <p>I was surprised lol.</p>
