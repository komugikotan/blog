<p>Hi, My name is Komugikotan.</p>

<p>I am a Japanese junior high school student living in the U.S., and I would like to write about what Japanese people think about living in the U.S.</p>
<p>I have been posting article about life in the U.S. on my Japanese blog, but I wanted to create an English version because Japanese is only understood in Japan,</p> 
<p>whereas English is understood all over the world. Please do me a favor!</p>
