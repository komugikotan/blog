<p>Hi, I went to fieldtrip today!(Actually not today but it's okay</p>

<div class="article-body">
    <h3 id="Fieldtrip!">Phone riots
</h3>
    <p>I went to the remedial school as usual, heard the usual warning not to go into the flower beds by the stairs, and went back to the classroom, but I needed to go to the bathroom, so I went to the bathroom.</p>
    <p>I got up from the toilet seat, and It sounded like</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 150%;">Something bump!</span></p>
    <p>At that moment, a bad premonition ran through my mind, "Could it be...?" When I turned around, I saw my iPhone had fallen onto the toilet seat!</p>
    <p>The moment I saw it, I thought "This is just like the one I saw in the Yokai Watch when Whisper dropped the Yokai pad in the toilet!"  I was impressed. I was not impressed at all lol.</p>

    <p>Then, without thinking, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I stuck my hand in the toilet bowl and picked up my iPhone.</span> I was amazed at myself for being able to act that way!

    <p> It was working right after I dropped it, but after some time it wouldn't start. According to dad, "It must have had a leak." He said.</p>

    <p>Then I came back to the classroom and got so upset that I got a score I had never gotten before on the Kanji test (like a spelling test) because of upset. And that's how this class ended.</p>
