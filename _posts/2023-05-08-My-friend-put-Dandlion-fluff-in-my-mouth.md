Long time to no see, I'm komugikotan, Hi.

### UPDATE Blog!!!!!

I wasn't updating blog for a long time, But I was not dead. I was simply busy with school, programming and studying.

Oh, I'm active on Github, so if **you're interested in programming**, take a look! (Just advertising) ⇓

So I'm going to tell you about a strange event that happened at school for the first time in a while.  

### Things happened in School

Today, I went to school as usual. We had a haiku class today, and we were supposed to write haiku while looking at the scenery outside. So we went outside for write haiku.

There were lots of dandelions blooming, so I thought I would write a haiku about dandelions. But it was very difficult to write haiku in English, so I wrote them in Japanese anyway.

Then girls from my class came over and said, "Can't you think of anything?" And they started talking to me like, "You can't think of any?"  I responded with something like, "Oh, I can't think of any," but then these girls asked me, "Do you think dandelions would taste good if you ate them?" (Why would they ask me such a question?) I was answering appropriately when L-chan, who calls herself "L", suddenly

**Putted dandelions (cotton wool) in my mouth. To make it eat.**

Of course, I thought I wouldn't eat it. But,

**I accidenly swallowed a third of it.**

I instantly spat out about two-thirds of it, but I swallowed a third of it.

The girl L says, "I thought your mouth would close when I offered it to you,"

There was no way I would close my mouth in time that suddenly.
